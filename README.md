# PhotoAlbumJavaFX

Relevant code PhotosApp/Photos/src/

This project was to create a program for managing user created albums with javaFX. Entering the user of "admin" will allow access to the admin page, allowing for new user creation. Logging into an enduser account, a user can begin creating albums, filling it with photos from their computer, tagging photos, searching for tag values, and generating new albums from the search results. User data persistance is done via serialization.
